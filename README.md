## Description

The back end of an e-commerce site that maintains the categories, products, and tags of items they offer. Technologies used include node.js, dotenv, javascript, npm packages such as express, sequelize, mysql2, and coding environment Visual Studio.

## Installation

Use the command "This application requires npm installation using Node.js. Users will also need access to a coding application/environment such as Visual Studio with access to GitBash or terminal to run Node. In the terminal, the command "npm i" is required, which installs all npm's used and their dependencies" to install any necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To use this application, run "Node server.js" in terminal, opening the port needed to access local host. When the port is open, the user can access their preferred browser and go to the localhost port, and use various "/" URL's listed in the code to see all/one, create, update, or delete any category/product/tag in the database.
